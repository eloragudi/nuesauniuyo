                        The University of Uyo was founded in 1991 by the Federal Government of Nigeria. At the time, there existed in Uyo the University of Cross River State which was established in 1981 by the then Cross River State Government. In 1987 Akwa Ibom State with headquarters at Uyo was created out of the Cross River State and from that time up to the time of Federal Government take-over in 1991, the University was jointly owned by Akwa Ibom and Cross River State Governments.
